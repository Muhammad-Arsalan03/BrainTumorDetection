# BrainTumorDetection
developed a binary classification system for detecting the brain tumor through MRI images.

Test set folder conntains the MRI images of brain tumor, further in test set there are two folders
1. with tumor 2. without tumor.  

with tumor folder contains  all the images which contain brain tumor diseease, while without tumor contains 
the images having no brain tumor disease.

brain_tumor.ipynb and brain_tumor.py contains the same python program but the difference is the first one is for jupyter notebook.

predict.ipynb and predict.py is used to predict the unseen data of MRI and tell use whether the image contain brain tumor or not
